A bad mod with a stubborn brain, I felt that I can't do anything at this time.

> This post was first written at Dec 10th 2017, posted in Jul 2018.

But actually, I still need to do something. Like the man who is going to die but he still need to keep alive.

I am Tired right? I feel my neck pain, brain stubborn at this time.
Like a low battery phone, can't do everything.

I said that I love program, but I can't read any program books, I can't wite any program, even I can't distinguish the C and the Python's basic phrases clearly.
I love using Linux system, But now I can't remember the most useful commands.
I want to update my website frequently, but when I open my computer, open my blog's directory, open a file editor, I don't know what should I say. But I still want to say manythings, the idea comes very fast and it disappeares before I write it down.

It's a bad thing that the brain is rusty now. Maybe I have some **Mental illness** ?
I am so afraid that there is someone don't like what I write in here, but how can I become the one who everybody likes?

Seems impossible.
I never try hard, right? I never try my best to do anything, I don't know what I really want.
But why I am so tired? Like a fool, don't do anything, feel scared anytime?

Someone is laughing at me?
I had my own thought, maybe I shouldn't care what they are thinking about.

## Updates:
Time goes very fast, it makes me forget even everything, forgot the felling I met with the new things. It changes me, makes me hate myself.
I don't want this happen, but time still going, there are many new things want to disturb me,
The worst felling is kind of helpless, want to kill myself but the scary stopped me.

No bless, no hope, no future,
I'm not fortunate, Every unfortunate things happen in these year, like someone want to hurt me on purpose.
Maybe This is Life?

I know there is a big hole on my head, It makes my head painful almost everyday.
That hole made me different from others, I want to escape from it, but I can't climb out of the hole.
Every strange thoughts, strange emotions appears from this hole, I can't control my thoughts, I can't explain actually why I do this, and I can't promise I won't do this again.
Just like "I know it is wrong, but I still want to do this; I know it's harm for me, but I still want to have a try"
Like self-defiction, I am Killing myself slowly, unconsiously.

If I don't do this, I will be more painful......

Hope you forgive me.

I always destroy the most important things, always make people go away from me.

I know nobody can help me,
Everything will be fine?
Seems impossible, but please don't make everything want to hurt me.
